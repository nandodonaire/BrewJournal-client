BrewJournal-client

BrewJournal is a full-stack web application that allows users to keep track of breweries they have visited, list the beers they've tried, and add notes about their experience at the brewery. BrewJournal allows users to save a list of breweries as well as additional information about each brewery to a relational database built using Ruby on Rails.

I got the idea for this project because I love craft beer and visiting breweries and wanted a way to keep track of the breweries I've visited.

Technologies Used for client: Ember, Bootstrap, Handlebars, and HTML5

User Stories:

1) As a user, I'd like to track which breweries I have visited.
2) As a user, I'd like to track which beers I've tasted at the breweries I've visited.
3) As a user, I'd like to add notes about the breweries I've visited.
4) As a user, I'd like to be able to delete and edit the notes I've added.
5) As a user, I'd like to be able to remove breweries from my list.

Features to add in the future:

1) The ability to add a second resourse (beers) that has a relationship to a brewery.
2) The ability to see a list of all of the beers as well as the brewery they 'belong to'.
3) A list of breweries that the user would like to visit in the future.
4) An integration with Google
